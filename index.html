                        AKane is not your average lightweight cane. It was designed with heavy-duty use in mind, providing maximum support and stability for those who need it. Made from kiln dried hickory, it includes a hand web support that doubles as a pack or bag hook, and a finger wedge to give a positive pistol style grip. Making it a versatile and rugged Alaska ready cane suitable for all types of terrain.

                <h3>Proto-Cane Developed</h3>
                <h4>Pre-Summarian Erra</h4>
                <p>
                    Octogenarians found that cutting long stems from sturdy plants helped them keep their balance while walking. They refined the design over time, eventually creating the proto-cane.

                <h3>More &quot;Traditional&quot; Form Perfected</h3>
                <h4>Classical Greek Erra</h4>
                <p>
                    Board Shepherds - a mischievous group of people who loved to play pranks on each other â€“ began using canes with curved handles. They used the curved handles to hook each other's clothing and knock each other off balance. Eventually, they realized that the curved handles were also useful for guiding animals, or to hang around the arm when they needed both hands. And so, the first curved-handle canes were born.

                <h3>AKane Refinements Made</h3>
                <h4>Pre/Mid Covid Erra</h4>
                <p>
                    Frustrated by the discomfort and limited functionality of store-bought canes, the creator of "AKanes" decided to make his own. He added a wider hook that could be hung on his shoulder instead of just his wrist. A custom patented hand web saddle for added hand grip and support. A finger wedge for easier one-handed manipulation of the hooked portion. A rubber grip to the top foot of the cane for added comfort and to assist with standing from a kneeling position. With these modifications, the Akane was as we know It was born.

            <h3>From Raw Wood to Premium AKanes</h3>
            <!-- <span class="education-date"></span> -->
            <h4>How we Make Them</h4>
            <p>
                Starting with a 6-foot 1" hickory dowel rod, we steam bend the crook to a 6" curl, tie it off, and dry kiln for a month. The dried "blank" is sanded to a taper at the crook end and a hand web hooked saddle stop is added at the beginning of the curve, bonded with an epoxy composite. An additional finger grip is added midway on the bottom of the grip curl. Optional coatings are available, but our standard is several coats of plastic dent-resistant clear epoxy over natural wood or gunmetal black. For clients needing greater shearing strength, fiberglass wrap can be added to the epoxy bond. Once the final coat is applied, a rubber wrap is added to the top third of the cane for ease in pulling oneself up from a kneeling position. The finished cane can weigh 1-2 pounds.
